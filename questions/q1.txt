#What is a pulsar?
*a rapidly spinning neutron star
a galaxy
a planet
a protostar
a black hole
@Correct. A pulsar is a type of star known as a neutron star. Pulsars have the unusual property that they produce beams of radio radiation which can be detected using a radio telescope on Earth. It is thought that not all neutron stars are pulsars. Some will have beams that do not point towards Earth and some may not emit such radiation at all. Neutron stars are thought to be the remnant core of massive stars formed during a supernova explosion. In the PULSE@Parkes project a variety of pulsars are observed and studied. More details on pulsars can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar" target="_blank">here</a>.
#How large is a pulsar?
twice the size of our sun
the size of the earth
*about the size of a city
the same size as our sun
@Surprisingly pulsars are much smaller than most stars, despite having a similar mass. The average pulsar is thought to have a diameter of around 20km, while our own sun which is a fairly average star has a diameter of 1 391 000 km. How do you think astronomers measure the mass and diameter of a pulsar? (note: this is tricky question, if you have trouble, ask your teacher or speak to the astronomers during a PULSE@Parkes observing session)
#How were pulsars first discovered?
*by observing pulses of radiation using a radio telescope
by observing flashes of light through an optical telescope
by space-based detectors for nuclear explosions
on photographic plates of the night sky
@Although it is possible to detect pulsars through flashes of visible light, this technique is not very common, and was certainly not used in the discovery of the first pulsar. The first pulsar was discovered in 1967 when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Bell_Burnell" target="_blank">Jocelyn Bell</a> (a student at the time) first noticed that there was a series of perfectly regular pulses in the radio data that she was analysing.
#What type of motion causes the pulses that are detected from pulsars?
*rotation of the star
expansion and contraction of the star
rapid vibration of the star
objects periodically moving in front of the star
@Pulsars are rapidly rotating compact stars, which emit a beam of radiation from the poles. When this beam of radiation is pointing at the earth we detect a pulse, when the beam is pointed away from the earth we see nothing. The animation below should give a good indication of how the pulses are generated by the rotation of the pulsar.<br> <img src="images/lightsmall-optimised.gif"><br>Image credit: Michael Kramer (MPIfR, Bonn)
#What is the typical rotation rate of a pulsar?
*once per second
once per hour
once per day
once per year
@The average pulsar will tend to rotate about once per second. However some pulsars have been discovered which rotate once every few milliseconds. The slowest known radio pulsar J2144-3933 has a period of 8.509827491 seconds. What is the fastest a pulsar can possibly rotate? (note: that the surface of the pulsar can not move faster than the speed of light)
#Can we normally detect individual pulses from a pulsar?
yes
*no
@It is normally very difficult to see individual pulses from a pulsar because the pulses are often weak. However there are still a small number of bright pulsars for which single pulses are visible, for example: Vela, J1717-4054 and B1449-64.<br><br><img width=300 height=300 src="images/bright_pulsar.png"><img width=300 height=300 src="images/noisy_pulsar.png"><br>The left image shows a set of 10 bright pulses from J1453-6413. The right image shows a set of 10 noisy pulses from J1634-5107(notice that the noise is so large the pulses aren't even visable).
#What is the preferred method used by pulsar astronomers to recover weak pulses from noisy data?
*add all the pulses together
only look at the brightest pulsars
use a bigger telescope
@Adding a large number of pulses together allows pulsar astronomers to get bright pulses from otherwise weak pulsars. This process is also commonly called folding, and is even used in cases where the pulses are bright because it gives a good description of the "average" pulse. The animation below shows how folding can recover a weak pulse from noisy data. <br><img WIDTH=340 HEIGHT=260 src="images/fold_ani.gif"><br> Of course, adding together the pulses relies on the observer knowing the rotational period of the pulsar. Over many years of observing a given pulsar the rotational period can be measured with exquisite precision. For example J0437-4715 is known to have a period of 0.005757451924362137 seconds. A pulsar with a short period means that a large number of pulses can be added together with only a short observation time, allowing weak pulses to be recovered quickly. How many pulses would be detected from J0437-4715 in 5 min?
#The easiest way to find the properties of a pulsar is:
*use the ATNF pulsar catalogue
use a search engine such as GOOGLE
ask a friend
@The ATNF pulsar catalogue can be found <a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/pulsar/psrcat/" target="_blank"> here </a>. <br><br> To look up the rotation period of a pulsar scroll to the bottom of the page and in the text box called Pulsar names enter the name of your pulsar, for example J1726-3530. Then using the list box just to the right of this text box select long (which means you want all the information about this pulsar), then click Get Ephemeris. The period of your pulsar is in the row named P0. If you chose J1726-3530 the period should be 1.11013244403 seconds. You will also see a number of other interesting pulsar properties on this page such as the Dispersion Measure (DM).
#Most pulsars are seen using radio telescopes. However, some pulsars have been detected at other wavelengths including:
Xray
Gamma rays
Optical
*Gamma ray, Xray and Optical
Xray and Optical
Gamma ray and Xray
Xray and Optical 
@Pulsars have been shown to produce extremely broadband electromagnetic radiation, which means that they are sometimes visible in a number of different spectra such as: Xray, Gamma ray and Optical.
