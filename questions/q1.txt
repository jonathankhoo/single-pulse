#What is a pulsar?
*a rapidly spinning neutron star
a galaxy
a planet
a protostar
a type of car
@Correct. A pulsar is a star. However a pulsar is a very strange star indeed, which exhibits some odd properties such as the periodic electro-magnetic radiation, which gives them their name. Pulsars are thought to be formed by massive stars which collapse during a supernova explosion.
#How large is a pulsar?
twice the size of our sun
the size of the earth
*about the size of a city
the same size as our sun
@Surprisingly pulsars are much smaller than most stars, despite having a similar mass. The average pulsar is thought to have a diameter of around 20km, while our own sun which is a fairly average star has a diameter of 1 391 000 km. 
#How were pulsars first discovered?
*by observing pulses of radiation using a radio telescope
by observing flashes of light through an optical telescope
by space-based detectors for nuclear explosions
on photographic plates of the night sky
@Although it is possible to detect pulsars through flashes of visible light, this technique is not very common, and was certainly not used in the discovery of the first pulsar. The first pulsar was discovered in 1967 when Jocelyn Bell (a student at the time) first noticed that there was a series of perfectly regular pulses in the radio data that she was analysing. It is now clear that pulsars were detected far earlier than this, but not recognized for what they were because their pulses resembled interference from nearby sources, such as cars.
#What type of motion causes the pulses that are detected from pulsars?
*rotation of the star
expansion and contraction of the star
rapid vibration of the star
objects periodically moving in front of the star
@Pulsars are rapidly rotating compact stars, which emit a beam of radiation from the poles. When this beam of radiation is pointing at the earth we detect a pulse, when the beam is pointed away from the earth we see nothing. The animation below should give a good indication of how the pulses are generated by the rotation of the pulsar.<br> <img src="images/lightsmall-optimised.gif"><br>
#What is the typical rotation rate of a pulsar?
*once per second
once per hour
once per day
once per year
@The average pulsar will tend to rotate about once per second. However some pulsars have been discovered which rotate once every few milliseconds. These are very inventively named millisecond pulsars.
#Can we normally detect individual pulses from a pulsar?
yes
*no
@It is normally very difficult to see individual pulses from a pulsar because the pulses are often weak. However there are still a small number of bright pulsars for which single pulses are visible, for example: Vela, J1717-4054 and B1449-64.
#What is the preferred method used by pulsar astronomers to recover weak pulses from noisy data?
*add all the pulses together
only look at the brightest pulsars
use a bigger telescope
@Adding a large number of pulses together allows pulsar astronomers to get bright pulses from otherwise weak pulsars. This process is also commonly called folding, and is even used in cases where the pulses are bright because it gives a good description of the "average" pulse. The animation below shows how folding can recover a weak pulse from noisy data. <br><img WIDTH=340 HEIGHT=260 src="images/fold_ani.gif"><br>
#The easiest way to find the properties of a pulsar is:
*use the ATNF pulsar catalogue
use a search engine such as GOOGLE
ask a friend
@The ATNF pulsar catalogue can be found <a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/pulsar/psrcat/" target="_blank"> here </a>. <br><br> To look up the rotation period of a pulsar scroll to the bottom of the page and in the text box called Pulsar names enter the name of your pulsar, for example J1726-3530. Then using the list box just to the right of this text box select long (which means you want all the information about this pulsar), then click Get Ephemeris. The period of your pulsar is in the row named P0. If you chose J1726-3530 the period should be 1.11013244403. You will also see a number of other interesting pulsar properties on this page such as the Dispersion Measure (DM).
#Most pulsars are seen using radio telescopes. However, some pulsars have been detected at other wavelengths including:
Xray
Gamma rays
Optical
*Gamma ray, Xray, Optical
Xray, Optical
Gamma ray, Xray
Xray, Optical 
@Pulsars have been shown to produce extremely broadband electromagnetic radiation, which means that they are sometimes visible in a number of different spectra such as: Xray, Gamma ray and Optical. 
#How may pulsars have been discovered?
less than 10
less than 100
a few hundred
*a few thousand
millions
@So far only .... pulsars have been discovered.
